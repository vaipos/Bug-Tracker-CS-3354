This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Downloading What you Need for this Repo

Please make sure you have the following downloaded:
- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you don't already have it
- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en)
OPTIONAL FOR GITHUB:
If you are more comfortable typing in the terminal for Git, then do that (it's like how the TA showed us that one day) OR you can download:
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

If you are still unsure how to use GIT, please look at the powerpoint our TA made for Git in the Box Folder.

## AFTER INSTALLATION

Open VsCode and click on the "Terminal" tab at the top and create new terminal:

In the terminal, clone the repository to your computer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaipos/Bug-Tracker-CS-3354.git
```
Next, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies.
```bash
cd Bug-Tracker-CS-3354
npm install
```

Finally, start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
